# Payment Register Invoice Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Payment Register Invoice Management feature according to the specification in `Payment_Register_Invoice_Feature.md`. The implementation adds mandatory invoice upload functionality to the Payment Register module and creates a new Master Files view for administrators.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **New Table**: `payment_invoices` with proper foreign key relationships
- **Migration**: Created `003_payment_invoices_table.sql` for database updates
- **Relationships**: Added `payment_invoices` relationship to Product model

### 2. API v2 Endpoints
All new endpoints follow the `/api/v2` prefix as specified:

#### Payment Register v2
- `GET /api/v2/payment-register` - Enhanced payment register with invoice data
- `PUT /api/v2/payment-register/{product_id}` - Update payment info (core fields only)

#### Invoice Management
- `POST /api/v2/invoices/{product_id}/invoices` - Upload multiple invoice files
- `GET /api/v2/invoices/{invoice_id}` - Download/preview specific invoice
- `DELETE /api/v2/invoices/{invoice_id}` - Delete specific invoice

#### Master Files
- `GET /api/v2/master-files/invoices` - List all invoices with filtering by product

### 3. File Storage
- **Storage Location**: `/home/evanzhang/EnterpriseProjects/PortalOpsStorage/bills/`
- **Naming Convention**: `{uuid}_{original_filename}` for collision prevention
- **File Types**: Supports PDF and other common document formats

### 4. Data Models
- **PaymentInvoice**: New SQLAlchemy model with proper relationships
- **Schemas**: Pydantic models for API request/response validation
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete CRUD operations with file management

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `app/models/payment_invoice.py` - PaymentInvoice SQLAlchemy model
- `app/schemas/payment_invoice.py` - Pydantic schemas for invoice data
- `app/crud/payment_invoice.py` - CRUD operations for invoices
- `app/api/api_v2/api.py` - API v2 main router
- `app/api/api_v2/endpoints/payment_register.py` - Payment register v2 endpoints
- `app/api/api_v2/endpoints/invoices.py` - Invoice file management endpoints
- `app/api/api_v2/endpoints/master_files.py` - Master files endpoints
- `migrations/003_payment_invoices_table.sql` - Database migration
- `test_invoice_feature.py` - Test script for verification

#### Modified Files
- `app/models/__init__.py` - Added PaymentInvoice import
- `app/models/service.py` - Added payment_invoices relationship to Product
- `app/crud/__init__.py` - Added payment_invoice CRUD
- `app/schemas/payment.py` - Added invoices field to PaymentInfoBase
- `app/main.py` - Added API v2 router

### Key Features

#### 1. Mandatory Invoice Upload
- Payment records now require at least one invoice file to be marked as "complete"
- File upload supports multiple files per payment record
- Proper file validation and error handling

#### 2. File Management
- Secure file storage outside project directory
- UUID-based file naming to prevent conflicts
- File deletion removes both database record and physical file
- Support for preview/download with proper MIME types

#### 3. Master Files View
- Read-only interface for administrators
- Lists all uploaded invoices across the system
- Filtering by product ID
- Includes product and service information

#### 4. Backward Compatibility
- **API v1 remains unchanged** - existing functionality preserved
- **Database schema** - new table added without affecting existing tables
- **No breaking changes** - all existing endpoints continue to work

## Testing

### Test Results
- ✅ Server health check passes
- ✅ API v1 endpoints still functional
- ✅ API v2 endpoints accessible and properly routed
- ✅ Storage directory created
- ✅ Database schema models exist
- ✅ No linting errors

### Test Script
Run `python test_invoice_feature.py` to verify implementation.

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require admin authentication
2. **File Validation**: Proper file type checking and size limits
3. **Path Security**: Files stored outside web root with UUID naming
4. **Audit Logging**: All invoice operations are logged for audit trail

## Usage Examples

### Upload Invoices
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v2/invoices/{product_id}/invoices" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "files=@invoice1.pdf" \
  -F "files=@invoice2.pdf"
```

### Get Payment Register with Invoices
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v2/payment-register" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### List All Invoices (Master Files)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v2/master-files/invoices" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Migration Instructions

1. **Database Migration**: Run the SQL migration script:
   ```sql
   \i migrations/003_payment_invoices_table.sql
   ```

2. **Storage Directory**: Ensure the storage directory exists:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /home/evanzhang/EnterpriseProjects/PortalOpsStorage/bills
   ```

3. **Restart Server**: The server will automatically pick up the new API v2 routes.

## Compliance with Specification

✅ **Mandatory Invoice Field**: Payment records require at least one invoice  
✅ **Multiple File Upload**: Support for multiple files per payment record  
✅ **File Management**: Preview and delete functionality for uploaded files  
✅ **Master Files View**: Read-only administrative interface  
✅ **API v2 Structure**: All endpoints follow `/api/v2` prefix  
✅ **File Storage**: Files stored in specified directory with UUID naming  
✅ **Database Schema**: New `payment_invoices` table as specified  
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: No impact on existing functionality  

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Update frontend to use new API v2 endpoints
2. **File Upload UI**: Implement drag-and-drop file upload component
3. **Master Files UI**: Create administrative interface for invoice viewing
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new endpoints

The implementation is complete and ready for frontend integration while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing systems.
