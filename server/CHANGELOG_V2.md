# PortalOps Backend v2.0 - Changelog

## Version 2.0 - 2025-10-17

### Major Changes

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Data Model
- **Non-Destructive Service Deletion**: Services can now be deleted without removing associated products. Products become "unassociated" and can be reassigned to other services.
- **Product Service Relationship**: `product.service_id` is now nullable, allowing products to exist without a service.
- **Simplified Role System**: Consolidated to two roles - `Admin` and `ServiceAdmin`.

#### üîí Authorization Updates
- **Stricter Permissions**: Service and Product CRUD operations now require `Admin` role exclusively.
- **User Management**: User listing and management now restricted to `Admin` role only.
- **Inbox Access**: Workflow tasks and inbox now Admin-only.

#### üìÅ File Management
- **Bill Attachments**: Payment register now supports file uploads for bill attachments.
- **Master Files Module**: New module to list and download all uploaded bill attachments.
- **File Storage**: Attachments stored in `uploads/bill_attachments/` directory.

#### üîÑ Workflow Enhancements
- **Offboarding Webhook**: New HR webhook endpoint for employee offboarding.
- **Task Completion**: New endpoint to complete tasks and trigger backend actions (user creation/deletion).
