# PortalOps v3 API Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the backend API implementation for the features specified in `product_requirements_v3.md` and `api_design_v3.md`.

## Date
October 22, 2025

## Changes Implemented

### 1. User Model Enhancements

#### 1.1 Database Model Updates
**File:** `server/app/models/user.py`

Added new fields to the `User` model:
- `position` (String) - User's job title/position
- `hire_date` (Date) - Date when the user was hired
- `resignation_date` (Date) - Date of resignation (nullable, defaults to NULL)

#### 1.2 Schema Updates
**File:** `server/app/schemas/user.py`

Updated schemas to include new fields:
- `UserBase` - Added position, hire_date, resignation_date
- `UserCreate` - Added new fields with resignation_date defaulting to None
- `UserUpdate` - Added new fields for updates
- `UserUpdateV2` - Added new fields for v2 unified updates

#### 1.3 CRUD Operations
**File:** `server/app/crud/user.py`

Updated `create()` method to:
- Accept and store position, hire_date fields
- Always set resignation_date to None for new users (as per requirements)

#### 1.4 API Endpoints
**File:** `server/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/users.py`

Updated endpoints to include new fields:
- `GET /api/users` - List users with position, hire_date, resignation_date
- `GET /api/users/{user_id}` - Get user details with new fields
- `PUT /api/users/{user_id}` - Update user including new fields
- `POST /api/users` - Create user with new fields

**Note:** The "Service Admin" role is already supported in the existing implementation. No additional changes were needed for role assignment.

### 2. Department Management Module

#### 2.1 Database Models
**File:** `server/app/models/department.py` (NEW)

Created two new models:
- `Department` - Represents company departments
  - `id` (UUID) - Primary key
  - `name` (String, unique) - Department name
  - `created_at` (DateTime)
  - `updated_at` (DateTime)

- `DepartmentProductAssignment` - Maps products to departments
  - `department_id` (UUID, FK)
  - `product_id` (UUID, FK)

#### 2.2 Schemas
**File:** `server/app/schemas/department.py` (NEW)

Created schemas:
- `DepartmentBase` - Base schema with name field
- `DepartmentCreate` - For creating departments
- `DepartmentUpdate` - For updating departments
- `Department` - Response model with full details
- `DepartmentProductAssignment` - Request model for product assignments
- `DepartmentProductAssignmentResponse` - Response after setting products

#### 2.3 CRUD Operations
**File:** `server/app/crud/department.py` (NEW)

Implemented CRUD operations:
- `get_by_name()` - Find department by name
- `get_department_products()` - Get all products assigned to a department
- `set_department_products()` - Replace all product assignments for a department

#### 2.4 API Endpoints
**File:** `server/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/departments.py` (NEW)

Created REST endpoints:

1. **GET /api/departments**
   - List all departments
   - Authorization: Admin only
   - Returns: Array of Department objects

2. **POST /api/departments**
   - Create a new department
   - Authorization: Admin only
   - Request: `DepartmentCreate`
   - Returns: Created Department object
   - Status: 201 Created

3. **PUT /api/departments/{department_id}**
   - Update a department's name
   - Authorization: Admin only
   - Request: `DepartmentUpdate`
   - Returns: Updated Department object

4. **DELETE /api/departments/{department_id}**
   - Delete a department and its product assignments
   - Authorization: Admin only
   - Status: 204 No Content

5. **GET /api/departments/{department_id}/products**
   - Get products assigned to a department
   - Authorization: Admin only
   - Returns: Array of Product objects

6. **PUT /api/departments/{department_id}/products**
   - Set (replace) product assignments for a department
   - Authorization: Admin only
   - Request: `DepartmentProductAssignment`
   - Returns: `DepartmentProductAssignmentResponse`

#### 2.5 Router Configuration
**File:** `server/app/api/api_v1/api.py`

Added department router:
```python
api_router.include_router(
    departments.router, prefix="/departments", tags=["departments"])
```

## Module Exports Updated

### 2.6 Models Export
**File:** `server/app/models/__init__.py`

Added exports:
- `Department`
- `DepartmentProductAssignment`

### 2.7 Schemas Export
**File:** `server/app/schemas/__init__.py`

Added exports:
- `Department`
- `DepartmentCreate`
- `DepartmentUpdate`
- `DepartmentProductAssignment`
- `DepartmentProductAssignmentResponse`

### 2.8 CRUD Export
**File:** `server/app/crud/__init__.py`

Added export:

---

## Audit Logging

All department-related actions are logged:
- `department.create` - When a department is created
- `department.update` - When a department is updated
- `department.delete` - When a department is deleted
- `department.products.update` - When product assignments are modified

---

## Important Notes

### Resignation Date Handling
As per requirements, `resignation_date`:
- Always defaults to `None` (NULL in database)
- Should not be displayed by default in the frontend
- Can be set during user updates if needed

### Service Admin Role
The existing implementation already supports:
- Assigning "Service Admin" role to users
- Distinguishing between "Admin" and "Service Admin" roles
- The role assignment logic in user endpoints works correctly for both roles

### Department-Based Product Allocation
The department product assignments table is ready. The **automatic product allocation logic** (where users inherit products from their department) should be implemented in the frontend or as a separate backend service/trigger depending on business requirements.

### Manual Override
As specified in the PRD, manual product assignments via the User Directory take precedence over department defaults. This is handled by the existing product assignment system.

---

## Database Schema Compatibility

All changes are compatible with the existing schema in `portalops_schema.sql`:
- User table already has position, hire_date, resignation_date columns
- Departments table exists
- Department_product_assignments table exists

No migration is needed as the database schema was already prepared.

---

## API Versioning

All new endpoints follow the existing v1 API structure:
- Base URL: `/api`
- Prefix: `/departments` for department endpoints
- Authentication: Bearer token required
- Authorization: Admin role required for all department operations

---

## Testing Recommendations

### User Endpoints
1. Test creating users with new fields (position, hire_date)
2. Verify resignation_date defaults to null
3. Test updating users with new fields
4. Verify "Service Admin" role assignment works correctly

### Department Endpoints
1. Test CRUD operations for departments
2. Test product assignment to departments
3. Test department deletion cascades to product assignments
4. Verify duplicate department names are rejected
5. Test fetching products for a department

---

## Next Steps

### Frontend Integration
1. Update User Directory to display position, hire_date
2. Add Department Master File page under Administration
3. Implement the Reusable Service & Product Selection Component
4. Update Add/Edit User panels to use the new component

### Optional Backend Enhancements
1. Add a helper function to get user's effective products (department + manual assignments)
2. Add validation for hire_date (should not be in the future)
3. Add validation for resignation_date (should be >= hire_date)
4. Consider adding an endpoint to bulk assign products based on department
