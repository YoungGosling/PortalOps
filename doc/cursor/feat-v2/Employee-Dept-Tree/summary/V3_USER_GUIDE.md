### Department-Less Users

You can create users without assigning a department:

- These users won't get automatic product updates

**Use cases:**

- Temporary users
- Cross-functional roles

## For Regular Users

### Viewing Your Information

In the Employee Directory, you'll see:
- Your name and email
- Your department
- Your position/title
- Your hire date
- Products you have access to

## FAQs

### Q: What happens if I change a department's products?

**A:** Changes only affect **new users** assigned to that department. Existing users are not automatically updated.

**Example:**
```
Today: Engineering has GitHub, AWS, Slack
       - Create user "Alice" ‚Üí gets GitHub, AWS, Slack

Tomorrow: Add "Figma" to Engineering department
       - Create user "Bob" ‚Üí gets GitHub, AWS, Slack, Figma
       - Alice still has: GitHub, AWS, Slack (unchanged)
```

### Q: Can I manually override department products?

**A:** Yes! Department products are defaults. You can:
- Remove products from department list
- Add products not in department
- Completely customize each user's access

### Q: Do I have to assign a department?

**A:** No, department is optional. Users without departments can still have products assigned manually.

### Q: What if a user needs access to multiple departments' products?

**A:** 
1. Assign them to their primary department
2. Manually add products from other departments
3. Or, don't assign a department and manually select all products

### Q: Can a user belong to multiple departments?

**A:** No, each user can only have one primary department. For cross-department access, manually assign additional products.

## Best Practices

### 1. Set Up Departments First

Before adding users:
- Create all departments in Dept Master File
- Assign products to each department
- Review and test with a dummy user

### 2. Use Departments for Common Patterns

Assign products to departments for:
- Standard company tools (email, chat, docs)
- Department-specific tools (CRM for sales, IDE for engineering)
- Default access levels

### 3. Manual Override for Exceptions

Use manual product selection for:
- Managers needing cross-department access
- Specialized roles with unique tool needs
- Temporary access grants

### 4. Review Regularly

Periodically review:
- Are department product assignments up-to-date?
- Do users have correct access?
- Are there unused product assignments?

## Workflow: Onboarding

When HR triggers an onboarding workflow:

1. Onboarding task appears in **Inbox**
2. Admin clicks **"Start"** on task
3. Form pre-filled with HR data (name, email, department)
4. **Select department** ‚Üí Products auto-assign
5. Adjust products if needed
6. Click **"Complete Onboarding"**
7. User created with all permissions

## Workflow: Offboarding

Offboarding workflow unchanged:
1. Task appears in Inbox
2. Admin reviews user info
3. Confirms offboarding
4. User and all access removed
