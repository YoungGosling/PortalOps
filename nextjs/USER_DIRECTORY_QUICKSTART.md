# User Directory - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The User Directory module had **non-functional Add, Edit, and Delete buttons**. All three operations now work correctly with full dialog integration.

## ✅ What's Working Now

### 1. Add User ➕
- Click "Add User" button
- Fill in user details (name, email, department)
- Select role (optional): Admin or ServiceAdmin
- Assign services (optional)
- Submit to create user

### 2. Edit User ✏️
- Click "Edit" button on any user row
- Modify user information
- Update service assignments
- Submit to save changes

### 3. Delete User 🗑️
- Click "Delete" button on any user row
- Review user details in confirmation dialog
- Confirm to permanently delete user and all assignments

### 4. Inbox Integration 📥

#### Onboarding Workflow
1. HR system creates onboarding task
2. Admin clicks "Start Task" in Inbox
3. User form opens with prefilled employee data (readonly)
4. Admin assigns services (required)
5. User is created and task marked complete

#### Offboarding Workflow
1. HR system creates offboarding task
2. Admin clicks "Start Task" in Inbox
3. User form opens showing existing assignments (readonly)
4. Admin confirms offboarding
5. User is deleted and task marked complete

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Avatars**: User initials in colored circles
- **Badges**: Role indicators (Admin, ServiceAdmin)
- **Icons**: Pencil for edit, Trash for delete
- **Loading States**: Spinners and disabled buttons
- **Validation**: Email format, required fields
- **Toast Notifications**: Success and error messages

## 🔐 Permissions

- **Admin Only**: User Directory is restricted to Admin role
- **Access Control**: Non-admin users see "Access Denied" message

## 🧪 Testing

All functionality has been tested:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All CRUD operations functional
- ✅ Form validation working
- ✅ Real-time data refresh
- ✅ Inbox workflow integration

## 🚀 Usage Example

```typescript
// The UserFormDialog component is reusable across the app

// 1. Regular Add/Edit (User Directory)
<UserFormDialog
  open={dialogOpen}
  onOpenChange={setDialogOpen}
  user={editingUser}           // null for Add, User object for Edit
  onSuccess={handleSuccess}
/>

// 2. Onboarding (Inbox)
<UserFormDialog
  open={dialogOpen}
  onOpenChange={setDialogOpen}
  user={null}
  onSuccess={handleSuccess}
  prefilledData={{
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@company.com",
    department: "Engineering"
  }}
/>

// 3. Offboarding (Inbox)
<UserFormDialog
  open={dialogOpen}
  onOpenChange={setDialogOpen}
  user={existingUser}
  onSuccess={handleSuccess}
  readonlyMode={true}
/>
```

## 📊 Data Structure

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  department?: string;
  roles: ('Admin' | 'ServiceAdmin')[];
  assignedServiceIds: string[];
}
```

## 🔗 API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/users` - Fetch all users
- `POST /api/users` - Create user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user
- `GET /api/services` - Fetch services for assignment

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Service Assignment**: Assigning a service gives user access to all products under that service
2. **Onboarding**: At least one service must be assigned to complete onboarding
3. **Offboarding**: Deletes user and removes all access automatically
4. **Real-time Sync**: All lists refresh automatically after any operation
5. **Validation**: Email format is validated before submission

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Buttons Not Responding?
- Check console for errors
- Ensure backend API is running
- Verify authentication token is valid

### Dialog Not Opening?
- Check React DevTools for state updates
- Verify onClick handlers are attached

### Changes Not Saving?
- Check network tab for API responses
- Verify request payload matches backend expectations
- Check for validation errors

## 📝 Notes

- All components follow the established design patterns from Service Inventory and Product Inventory
- The implementation is fully compliant with PRD v2.0 specifications
- The UserFormDialog is a single reusable component for all user operations
- Real-time data synchronization ensures UI always shows current state
