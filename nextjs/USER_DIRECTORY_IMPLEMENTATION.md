# User Directory Module Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of the User Directory module according to the PRD v2.0 specifications. The module includes full CRUD operations for user management, service assignment, and integration with the Inbox workflow for onboarding/offboarding.

## Implemented Components

### 1. UserFormDialog Component

**Location:** `/components/users/UserFormDialog.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ **Add Mode**: Create new users with name, email, department, role, and service assignments
- ✅ **Edit Mode**: Update existing user information and permissions
- ✅ **Onboarding Mode**: Prefilled readonly fields (name, email, department) with mandatory service assignment
- ✅ **Offboarding Mode**: Display user information in readonly mode with confirmation to delete

**Key Functionalities:**
- Service assignment with visual selection interface
- Multi-service selection support
- Role assignment (Admin, ServiceAdmin)
- Email validation
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design with scrollable content

**Validation Rules:**
- Name and email are required fields
- Email must be valid format
- For onboarding: At least one service must be assigned
- For offboarding: Confirmation deletes the user and all assignments

### 2. DeleteUserDialog Component

**Location:** `/components/users/DeleteUserDialog.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Confirmation dialog with user details display
- ✅ Shows avatar, name, email, department, roles, and assigned service count
- ✅ Warning message about access removal
- ✅ Destructive action styling (red button)
- ✅ Loading state during deletion

### 3. User Directory Page

**Location:** `/app/(internal)/users/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Admin-only access control
- ✅ User list display with:
  - Avatar (initials)
  - Name and email
  - Role badges
  - Department information
  - Edit and Delete buttons with icons
- ✅ Empty state with helpful message
- ✅ Loading skeleton animation
- ✅ Add User button in header and empty state
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization after CRUD operations

**Button Handlers:**
- `handleAddUser()`: Opens dialog for creating new user
- `handleEditUser(user)`: Opens dialog with user data for editing
- `handleDeleteUser(user)`: Opens delete confirmation dialog
- `handleDialogSuccess()`: Refreshes user list after any operation

### 4. Inbox Integration

**Location:** `/app/(internal)/inbox/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ **Onboarding Workflow**: 
  - "Start Task" opens UserFormDialog with prefilled readonly data
  - Admin must assign at least one service
  - Creates new user in User Directory
  - Marks task as completed automatically
  
- ✅ **Offboarding Workflow**:
  - "Start Task" finds user by email and opens UserFormDialog in readonly mode
  - Displays user's current service assignments
  - Confirmation deletes user from User Directory
  - Marks task as completed automatically

**Implementation Details:**
- `handleStartTask(task)`: Routes to onboarding or offboarding flow
- `handleTaskComplete()`: Refreshes task list and closes dialog
- Integration with UserFormDialog via props:
  - `readonlyMode`: For offboarding
  - `prefilledData`: For onboarding

## Data Flow

### Add User Flow
```
User clicks "Add User" 
  → Opens UserFormDialog (Add Mode)
  → User fills form and assigns services
  → API creates user
  → Success callback refreshes user list
  → Dialog closes
```

### Edit User Flow
```
User clicks "Edit" on user row
  → Opens UserFormDialog (Edit Mode) with user data
  → User modifies fields
  → API updates user
  → Success callback refreshes user list
  → Dialog closes
```

### Delete User Flow
```
User clicks "Delete" on user row
  → Opens DeleteUserDialog with user details
  → User confirms deletion
  → API deletes user
  → Success callback refreshes user list
  → Dialog closes
```

### Onboarding Flow (from Inbox)
```
HR system triggers onboarding webhook
  → Task appears in Inbox
  → Admin clicks "Start Task"
  → Opens UserFormDialog with readonly employee info
  → Admin assigns services (required)
  → API creates user
  → Task marked as completed
  → User list and task list refresh
```

### Offboarding Flow (from Inbox)
```
HR system triggers offboarding webhook
  → Task appears in Inbox
  → Admin clicks "Start Task"
  → Finds user by email
  → Opens UserFormDialog in readonly mode showing assignments
  → Admin confirms offboarding
  → API deletes user
  → Task marked as completed
  → User list and task list refresh
```

## API Integration

The following API endpoints are used:

- **GET** `/api/users` - Fetch all users
- **POST** `/api/users` - Create new user
- **PUT** `/api/users/:id` - Update user

- **GET** `/api/services` - Fetch services for assignment

Request/Response types are defined in `/types/index.ts`:
