# Color Scheme Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the PortalOps frontend to match the design specifications from the provided screenshots while preserving Azure login functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Global CSS Updates (`app/globals.css`)

#### Background Colors
- Changed main background from pure white to a subtle gray: `--background: 0 0% 98%`
- Changed sidebar background to pure white: `--sidebar-background: 0 0% 100%`
- Updated sidebar accent color: `--sidebar-accent: 240 5% 96%`

This provides better visual hierarchy and reduces eye strain with the slightly off-white background.

### 2. Dashboard Component (`components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`)

#### Stat Card Enhancements
- Added left border accent to stat cards matching their color theme
- Updated icon container backgrounds to lighter shades (bg-blue-50, bg-green-50, etc.)
- Increased icon size from `h-4 w-4` to `h-5 w-5` for better visibility
- Made value text larger: `text-3xl` instead of `text-2xl`
- Updated title styling to use muted foreground color
- Enhanced trend indicators with font-medium weight

#### Welcome Message
- Simplified welcome message format to match design spec

### 3. Inbox Component (`components/inbox/Inbox.tsx`)

#### Added Status Summary Cards
- Added 4 summary cards at the top showing:
  - Pending tasks (yellow theme)
  - In Progress tasks (blue theme)
  - Completed tasks (green theme)
  - Escalated tasks (red theme)
- Each card shows count and appropriate icon

#### Added Search and Filter
- Added search input with search icon
- Added status filter dropdown (All Status, Pending, Completed)
- Implemented filtering logic for both search and status

#### Enhanced Task Cards
- Added icon containers with background colors
- Redesigned task layout with clearer information hierarchy
- Updated badge styling:
  - Pending: Yellow background with lowercase text
  - Completed: Green background with lowercase text
- Added due date display
- Added service details and assigned to sections
- Added comments button for pending tasks
- Removed duplicate CardContent sections

### 4. Route Structure Cleanup
Removed duplicate pages from `(admin)` folder that were causing build errors:
- dashboard/page.tsx
- inbox/page.tsx
- services/page.tsx
- products/page.tsx
- payment-register/page.tsx
- users/page.tsx

These pages now only exist in the `(internal)` folder as intended.
