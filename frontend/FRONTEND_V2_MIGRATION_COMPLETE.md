### Reusable Patterns

## üìù API Integration Notes

The frontend is now fully aligned with the v2.0 API specification:

### Expected Backend Changes
1. **Services API**: Support `productIds`, `associateProductIds`, `disassociateProductIds`
2. **Products API**: Support `serviceId` filter query parameter
3. **Payment API**: Accept `multipart/form-data` for file uploads
4. **Users API**: Return `assignedServiceIds` in profile and user responses
5. **Workflow API**: Single `POST /inbox/tasks/{id}/complete` endpoint
6. **Master Files API**: Endpoints at `/master-files/attachments`

### Error Handling
All API calls include proper error handling with user-friendly toast notifications.

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Simplified Permissions**: v2.0 uses only `assignedServiceIds` (no more product-level assignments)
2. **Non-destructive Service Deletion**: Products become "unassociated" instead of being deleted
3. **Automatic Billing Records**: Created with products, deleted with products
4. **Inline Payment Editing**: No separate form dialog required
5. **Workflow Automation**: HR webhooks trigger onboarding/offboarding tasks
6. **Unified Add/Edit Panels**: Consistent UX across all modules
7. **Real-time Data Sync**: All pages refresh after create/update/delete operations

## üé® UI Highlights

- **Beautiful Dashboard**: Stats cards with trend indicators matching the provided design
- **Service Cards View**: Visual card layout with product counts
- **Inline Payment Editing**: Modern, efficient editing experience
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges and icons throughout
- **Empty States**: Friendly messages with call-to-action buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Dark Mode**: Fully supported via theme provider

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: Ensure backend API implements v2.0 specification
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete workflows with real API
3. **HR Webhook Integration**: Set up external HR system webhooks
4. **File Storage**: Configure file upload destination for bill attachments
5. **Performance Testing**: Test with realistic data volumes
6. **User Training**: Prepare documentation for end users
