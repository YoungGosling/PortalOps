## 📝 Notes

1. **Backend Integration**: All API endpoints referenced in the frontend need to be implemented in the backend according to the updated specifications.

2. **File Upload**: The bill attachment upload functionality requires backend support for multipart/form-data handling and file storage.

3. **HR Webhooks**: The Inbox functionality requires two webhook endpoints (`/api/inbox/onboard` and `/api/inbox/offboard`) to be implemented in the backend.

4. **Real-Time Updates**: Consider implementing WebSocket support for real-time sidebar badge updates when multiple admins are working simultaneously.

5. **Validation**: Client-side validation is implemented. Ensure backend also validates:
   - Unique product names
   - Required service for products
   - At least one service/product assignment for users
   - All billing fields for completeness
